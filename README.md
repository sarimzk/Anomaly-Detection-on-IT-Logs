# Anomaly Detection on IT logs implementing DeepLog architecture

The use of logs is an essential tool in detecting anomalies in any systems, in many cases this process is a manual, cumbersome and requires the constant monitoring of logs with a human component. This project aim to use [DeepLog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At19CBGpbMI) architecture as a technique for generic log files.
